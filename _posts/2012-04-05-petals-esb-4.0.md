Petals 4.0 has just been released.

It includes a lot of improvements for users, as well as optimisations, and nice new features :
- Latest container with new kernel 3.2, which brings strong enhancements under the hood: beyond usual performance/stability profits, many parts have been rewritten to prepare for exciting new features.
- A new business monitoring system: no more Petals View+KPI, now all is based on plain texts logs, for extensive configurability and choice in third-party exploitation tool.
- A new Command Line Interface: now brings all essential administration tools in one dedicated shell, usable locally or remotely (including replacement for old "stop" and "shutdown" scripts).
- Pack of updates for most used components, to make them compatible with the new monitoring: Filetransfer, FTP, Mail, SFTP, SOAP, SQL, BPEL, EIP, JSR, Quartz, Validation, XSLT.
- BC-SOAP now supports WS-Security and SSL connexions.
- BC-Filetransfer is simpler to use as a service provider, and is now ready for high availability use-cases as a consumer.
- Petals startup script has been improved, using your feedback as guidelines.

Also, please note that package structure of the container and our versioning policy has slightly evolved.
